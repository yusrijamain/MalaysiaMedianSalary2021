# Malaysia Median Salary, 2010 - 2021

## About the Project
The problem at hand is to analyze and comprehend the distribution of median salaries in Malaysia. As a diverse and rapidly developing nation, Malaysia’s economy undergoes dynamic changes influenced by factors like industry growth, technological advancements, inflation and policy shifts. The median salary, representing the midpoint of the income distribution, offers valuable insights into the population's economic well-being.

## Project Summary
### Problem Statement: 
Investigate the disparities behind the differences in median salaries to provide insights into income distribution and economic equality within the country.
### Business Objective:
Create an interactive dashboard containing the median salary trends in Malaysia across different demographics, education, industries, ethnicities and strata.
### Outcome:
Cleaned, aggregated and analyzed data using Excel and SQL. Joint tables and designed an interactive dashboard using Tableau to track median salary trends across key variables in Malaysia from 2010 to 2021.

## About the Data
For this project, we used open datasets from the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM). The datasets contain responses from the National Salaries & Wages Survey that had been categorized according to various key variables.

There are 6 datasets that were used for this project that pertain to these variables: [age](https://open.dosm.gov.my/data-catalogue/dosm-public-economy_salaries_age_sex_2), [certification](https://open.dosm.gov.my/data-catalogue/dosm-public-economy_salaries_certification_sex_2) (education), [ethnicity](https://open.dosm.gov.my/data-catalogue/dosm-public-economy_salaries_ethnicity_sex_2), [industry](https://open.dosm.gov.my/data-catalogue/dosm-public-economy_salaries_industry_sex_2), [state](https://open.dosm.gov.my/data-catalogue/dosm-public-economy_salaries_state_sex_2), and [strata](https://open.dosm.gov.my/data-catalogue/dosm-public-economy_salaries_strata_sex_2).

## Methodology of the Analysis
### 1. Collect relevant data
Collect datasets from reliable and trusted sources. This is to ensure the integrity of the outcome and validity of the insights produced.
### 2. Data Cleaning
Clean the datasets by removing irrelevant columns, trailing/leading spaces, and ‘null’ values.
### 3. Data Aggregation
Import all the Excel files to Microsoft SQL Server; use CTE, Window and Aggregate functions to perform calculations and extract insights from the datasets.
### 4. Visualize in Tableau
Merge all the tables in a single Excel workbook, separated by worksheets that indicate its variable type e.g. age, ethnicity, state etc. Import the data to Tableau, and join the tables using a unique key
